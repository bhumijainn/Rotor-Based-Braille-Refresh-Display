# Rotor-Based-Braille-Refresh-Display
Designed a **Verilog-based Braille display system** that converts real-time ASCII text input into Braille using a custom-built rotor mechanism. Implemented an **angle-aware finite state machine (FSM)** to control the physical movement of rotors, and used an **ASCII-to-Braille lookup table (LUT)** for fast character mapping. The system accurately renders dynamic text in tactile Braille format, enabling real-time accessibility for visually impaired users.
